# ESP32MiniDrop
This repository contains the source files for a DIY solenoid controller to use for water drop photography. This project is still a work in progress, so be on the look out for updates.

Some features of this design include:
* Bluetooth / Wifi connectivity
* 12 V Solenoid Control
* Shutter Control
* Android/IOS App

## Usage
The goal for this device is to help make water drop photography a snap. Water drop photography focuses on macro shots of water or other liquids at various stages of impact. A electronically controlled valve (or solenoid) positioned above a pool of liquid enables you to use this controller to adjust the timing between succesive drops, the size of the drops themselves, and when to tell the camera to take the picture. By connecting your phone to the controller, you'll be able to dial in these settings and get significantly more repeatable shots than with more manual methods.

## What you'll need
Once you've got an ESP32MiniDrop board in hand, there's a few things needed to get everything ready for pictures. 
#### Solenoid
The star of the show is the electrionically controlled valve known as a solenoid. The ESP32MiniDrop is designed for 12V DC solenoids, with a typical power usage of 6-8 Watts. When buying a solenoid, make sure to look for one that is 2 port (one way in and one way out) and prefereablly where the valve body is made of brass. This helps to prevent corrosion if you decide to experiment with other liquids. Wiring the solenoid should be easy, just use stranded core wire and attach to the terminals on the solenoid and then the controller.

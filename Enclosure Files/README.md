# Enclosure

Designed in FreeCAD 0.18

Here are the design files for a 3D printable plastic enclosure for the ESP32MiniDrop. There are two pieces, a Top and Bottom. STEP files are included to help visualize the pieces, feel free to 

## Printing
To start 3D printing, download the STL Files or modify the CAD files and export to STL.

A test print is planned and will be reported here. 

Using Prusa Slicer 2.2.0 with the following settings gives a print time of 5h 12m
- Layer Height | 0.10mm Detail 
- Filament     | Generic PLA   
- Supports     | None          
- Infill       | 80%           

## Overview
Here is an orhtographic view of the assembled case, along with a size comparison to a Sony DSLR and 12V Solenoid Valve. 

Light pipes for the two status LEDs can be created using 3mm diameter acrylic rods, cut to 12mm and inserted into the top piece.

There are 4 M2 Screw holes that for now just self tap into the top section plastic. Threaded inserts would be great addition, or maybe an embedded nut. Screw length should be between 6mm and 8mm.

# Enclosure

Designed in FreeCAD 0.18

Here are the design files for a 3D printable plastic enclosure for the ESP32MiniDrop. There are two pieces, a Top and Bottom. 

Light pipes for the two status LEDs can be created using 3mm diameter acrylic rods, cut to 12mm and inserted into the top piece.

There are 4 M2 Screw holes that for now just self tap into the top section plastic. Threaded inserts would be great addition, or maybe an embedded nut. Screw length should be between 6mm and 8mm.

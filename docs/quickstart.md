**Note:** This project is still a work in progress. This quick start guide is a reference for what the goal is for a generic device set up. This might change as the project progresses.

# What you'll need

 - 12V 1A DC Power Supply
 - MiniDrop Controller
 - Android or IOS app
 - DSLR/Mirrorless Camera with shutter release cable
 - 12V DC Solenoid
 - Light Stand or Tripod
 - 3D Printed Fittings
 - M8 Threaded Rods (x2)
 - Nuts & Bolts
 - Plastic beverage bottle
 
 

## Plugging In
Turning on the controller is as simple as plugging in the power adapter. Make sure the adapter is 12V and can give at least 1A of current. 

The green LED should be illuminated when the controller has power. The blue LED should be fading in and out while the device is in pairing mode. 

## Connecting

On first power on, the controller should automatically go into pairing mode. 

On your phone, find the MiniDrop among the available Bluetooth devices. The MiniDrop controller should remember your phone and attempt to automatically connect to it even after a power reset.

Open the app, and confirm the device and app are connected to each other. 

## Setting up the Stand

Attach two M8 threaded rods to the counter weight and secure using hex nuts on each side of the weight. 

Slip in two solenoid retaining clips onto the rear rod.

Attach end piece to open end of threaded rods and secure on both sides using hex nuts.

Mount bottom clamp piece onto tripod or light stand using the center hex nut.

Place threaded rods in between the bottom bracket and the top bracket and tighten using the two M6 hex bolts and nuts.

## Setting up the Solenoid

**Note:** Solenoids are big coils, most of the time polarity doesn't matter.

Remove the retaining bolt on the DIN 43650 connector, and removing the plastic cover to reveal the screw terminals. 

Pass through 2 wires and attach to screw terminals. 

**Note:** Be sure to expose just enough bare wire to fit inside the screw terminal

Replace plastic cover on the DIN 43650 connector and thighten retaining bolt.

Mount the solenoid into the solenoid bracket using M4 Screws and snap the bracket onto the threaded rods inbetween the retaining clips.

**Note:** You can loosen the plunger retaining thumb screw to move the coil by 90&deg;. The orientation most solenoids come in are just to make it smaller for packaging.

Thread 1/4 inch NPT male coupler into the Bottle Adapter, and attach to solenoid inlet port.

Thread 1/4 inch NPT hose barb into the solenoid's outlet port.

Cut the bottom off of a plastic beverage bottle and thread into bottle adapter. Use this to hold the water you'll be dropping.

Wire the solenoid into the MiniDrop controller's screw terminals.

## Setting up the Camera

Position a bowl of water below the solenoid, and the camera in front of this. If you have wireless flash triggers, you can use those to position the speedlight(s) for different lighting effects.

Set the camera to manual and adjust the settings to fit your lighting and lens. A good shutter speed is 1/200 Second. Without the flash there should be no exposure (all black), and the flash will be used to freeze the action.

## Creating a Shot Profile

In the app, add two drops with 100 ms delays each and a size of 20 ms, and a picture with a delay of 120 ms. 

Tap go and check the results. Adjust the size of the drops and the  delays until the next action until you've gotten a repeatable result. 

Save the profile to use later, but know that if you change the height of the solenoid next time it will be different timings.

![printing]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/IMG_7778.jpg)

Over the weekend I got around to test printing the two enclosure pieces on a Prusa i3.

The prints came out really well, only downside is the filament color makes it hard to see the details in photos. 

One thing that I am noticing is the use of M2 screws might need to be changed, they are quite small. 

I might make some small adjustments to the enclosure, but it's not a priority. Everything mates up, and its looking good for a fit check with the real PCB.

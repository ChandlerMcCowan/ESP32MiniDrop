Starting off the project website, and getting a hang of creating a static website using Jekyll. So far so good, but it certainly isn't a walk in the park. There are a lot of gotchya's and prerequisite knowledge needed to know how to get to where you want to end up. 

Right now I am developing on a Windows machinge using Notepad++. There's a lot to improve with the development setup, but I'll save that for later. I want to focus on the project's documentation. 

Right now, I am waiting on `A01` boards to arrive. I have recieved parts from Digikey, and I have a solenoid from Heschen. I test printed the enclosure. As usual, it looks bigger in CAD.

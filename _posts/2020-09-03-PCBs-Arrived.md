It's always an exciting time in a hardware project's life when you get that first batch of PCBs in from the fab house.

I ordered these PCBs from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) using their prototype 2 layer service. The choice of black solder mask increased build time from 1 day to 3 days, but I'd say the delay is well worth it.

Overall, shipping was reasonable, it took about a week and a half before they arrived.

Next step is a fit check of all the through hole components and the enclosure.

Everything is looking good and fitting nicely. The only issue I have with the enclosure design right now is the reset button is hard to get to, but some might argue that a reset button should be hard to get to.

## What's next

I plan on assembling one board this weekend to use as a first hardware test. I need to throw together some firmware to start the initial testing, and I hope to do some more printing this weekend while I burn my hands on the soldering iron.
